# Simple-Pokedex-in-Python

Description:
On this project, I wanted to practice tkinter a little more and increase or change some features compared to my previous simple CRUD project. 
The main change was the data source, instead of a Database, I wanted to extract from a .XLSX file. 

Libraries:

-Tkinter: tried to explore more tkinter features and logics to compose the Treeview widget 

-Pandas: to read the .XLSX file 

-Pillow: to use images on the tkinter window
